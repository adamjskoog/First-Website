Idris Elba to star in 70s-based black activism mini-series 'Guerilla',"Idris Elba will star in a new mini-series based around black activism in 1970s London, entitled Guerilla.

Written by John Ridley (12 Years A Slave, Ben Hur, Three Kings), the plot will centre on an underground cell and the freeing of a political prisoner. 

The official synopsis reads:

""Guerilla is a love story set against the backdrop of one of the most politically explosive times in U.K. history. It tells the story of a politically active couple whose relationship and values are tested when they liberate a political prisoner and form a radical underground cell in 1970s London. Their ultimate target becomes the Black Power Desk, a true-life, secretive counter-intelligence unit within Special Branch dedicated to crushing all forms of black activism.""

Elba has been speaking to TVLine about the project, and sounds excited by the concept. He said:

""It’s been a long time desire of mine to collaborate with Mr. Ridley and his work here is nothing short of a masterclass in character building and story-telling. TV is in for a treat.""

The show is expected to run on Sky Atlantic in the UK. 

Elba was also named on Time's Most Influential List this week, with The Wire director David Simon saying of the actor:

“I knew Elba, as true a leading man as I’d ever encountered, was not going to starve."" He added that he told Elba: “Brother, you’re never going to lack for work again. You’re going straight to features. Don’t you realize that?”",http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/idris-elba-to-star-in-70s-based-black-activism-min/405327,http://nme.assets.ipccdn.co.uk/images/2014IdrisElba_Getty474270267070314.jpg
Emilia Clarke rules out appearing in 'Terminator' sequels,"Emilia Clarke, who played Sarah Conor in the latest Terminator film, has said she will not appear in any sequels.

The actor responded bluntly when she was asked if she would reprise the role, telling film site Coming Soon: “No. Can I say that? It’s okay. No. Uh-uh. But I have some very different roles coming up.”

Clarke starred in the fifth film in the science fiction franchise, Terminator Genisys, which was released last year. Set in 1984, it follows Sarah Connor during her younger years, before the birth of her son John Connor, who goes on to become the leader of the human resistance. The film also saw the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who last appeared in the third instalment of the series, 2003’s Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.

While Genisys grossed over $440m in the box office, it received mixed reviews from critics. Following its release, Skydance chief creative officer Dana Goldberg announced that the franchise would be “readjusting” its plans for additional Terminator sequels.

Game Of Thrones season six about 'rebuilding characters' lives' - producer,"Bryan Cogman - writer and producer of Game Of Thrones - has talked about what to expect from the latest episodes of the popular drama series, describing season six as a ""rebuilding"" season.

Cogman compared the darkness of the fifth season with the soon-to-launch latest, and also described the new outing as ""the hardest to write so far,"" as the episodes will not be a direct adaptation from the books.

""Season 5 was about taking characters to the brink – and for certain characters like Stannis and Jon, destroying them altogether,"" Cogman told Entertainment Weekly. 

""We left our central characters in huge moments of crisis and at their lowest points last year. All of them are now trying to rebuild their lives. Season 5 was in many ways our darkest. This season is still very dark, very intense, but it’s very much a next act.""

The final trailer for season 6 was unveiled earlier this week ahead of the series' return this weekend, and can be seen below, via YouTube:



Cogman also described the new season as ""Westeros 2, an alternative Westeros,"" because of the move away from Martin's written version of the story, which has now been overtaken by the televised version.

""It was the hardest season to write for that very reason,"" he explained. ""While we’re still drawing from a lot of situations and arcs in the books, it’s obviously not a direct adaptation of any of the books this year."" 

""I will say you’ll see character versions and interpretations that are in some of the previous books that we hadn’t gotten to yet. I think of it as Westeros 2 – the alternate universe version of Westeros. There’s the book universe and a show universe and this is what happens in the show universe.""

Cogman also dealt with the challenges of the season, in particular in keeping the plotline on course. He explained:

""Not letting everyone get overwhelmed by the size of it and keeping your eye on the prize [are the greatest challenges] – the clarity of the characters and their motivations. You can obsess about a sequence or a line of action, but if you lose sight of the story then none of it matters.""

Garbage launch new single 'Empty' - listen,"Garbage have unveiled 'Empty', the first single from their forthcoming album 'Strange Little Birds', and the first single taken from an album since 2012's 'Control'.

Vocalist Shirley Manson has described the track as ""exactly what it says it is, a song about emptiness.""

Garbage had previously released a stand-alone single every year since the launch of their fifth album, 2012's 'Not Your Kind Of People'. 

'Strange Little Birds' - which will be released on the band's own label STUNVOLUME on June 10 - has been described by Manson as ""less fussed over"" than anything Garbage have ever made, with Butch Vig adding that the band ""fell in love with immediacy.""

Listen to the new track via YouTube, below:



Speaking of the album, Vig later added:

""It's quite different for us. It’s very cinematic and there are a lot of sonic moments on the record that are not necessarily typical Garbage. We sort of took the rock out and deconstructed the songs, made them more vulnerable-sounding."" 

""Some moments get completely crazy, completely blown out. I think it’s one of those records people are going to listen to the first time and go, ‘Wow, what was that?’ They’re gonna need to hear it a couple times to get into it. But we’re really happy with it. We hope Garbage fans will find it as interesting as we do.”

At the time of the album launch, Manson said “To me, this record, funnily enough, has the most to do with the first record than any of the previous records. It’s getting back to that beginner’s headspace. In part, that’s a result of not having anyone to answer to.""

As well as a the album, Garbage have also promised further live dates to add to the current European tour, though it's not clear if those dates will include further UK appearances. At present their two UK dates come right after the album launch, as follows:

Troxy, London (June 13) 
Rock City, Nottingham (June 14) 

The full tracklisting for 'Strange Little Birds' will be as follows:

""Carver County Sheriff Jim Olson reports that on April 21, 2016, at about 9:43 am, sheriff’s deputies responded to a medical call at Paisley Park Studios in Chanhassen.

He was pronounced deceased at 10:07 am. He has been identified as Prince Rogers Nelson (57) of Chanhassen.

The Carver County Sheriff’s Office, with the assistance of the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office and The Midwest Medical Examiner’s Office, are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding his death.""

The singer's publicist, Yvette Noel-Schure, has made the following statement: “It is with profound sadness that I am confirming that the legendary, iconic performer, Prince Rogers Nelson, has died at his Paisley Park residence this morning at the age of 57. There are no further details as to the cause of death at this time.”

Recent reports claimed that the singer’s private jet was forced to make an emergency landing in Illinois on April 15 for health reasons. He later spent a short period of time in hospital there. The next day, he appeared in concert. Sources close to Prince said he was suffering a ""bad bout of flu"". 

He reportedly threw a public party at Paisley Park on Saturday (April 16), to celebrate the good weather and the support and love he had been shown since he was taken to hospital the previous day. Referring to the stories about his health, he told the crowd: ""Wait a few days before you waste any prayers.""

Born Prince Rogers Nelson on June 7, 1958, the singer went on to release 39 studio albums over a music career that lasted nearly 40 years. He rose to world fame in 1982 with the release of fifth album ‘1999’, and achieved worldwide success with his sixth, 1984’s ‘Purple Rain’, which was certified platinum in countries including the USA, UK, Australia, Switzerland and France. 

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, with the following tribute: ""He rewrote the rulebook, forging a synthesis of black funk and white rock that served as a blueprint for cutting-edge music in the Eighties. Prince made dance music that rocked and rock music that had a bristling, funky backbone. From the beginning, Prince and his music were androgynous, sly, sexy and provocative.""

Last year he released two albums, ‘HITnRUN Phase One’ and ‘HITnRUN Phase Two’. He was recently reported to be in the middle of writing his memoir, ‘The Beautiful Ones’.",http://www.nme.com/news/prince/93141,http://nme.assets.ipccdn.co.uk/images/2015Prince_Press1_040215.jpg
"Azealia Banks previews new tracks, reveals one was intended for Rihanna","Azealia Banks previewed several new tracks from upcoming projects on Periscope last night.

The rapper played snippets from songs that are set to appear on her new mixtape ‘Fantasea II’ and another release, ‘Business and Pleasure’. 

Banks also appeared to suggest that one of the demos was originally written for Rihanna. ""You wanna hear one of the songs I did for, what's this bitch, antioxidant?"" she said, a term she's previously used to refer to Rihanna's latest album ‘Anti’ on Twitter. Listen to the track below.

Asked when they might see release, Banks said she plans to drop 'Fantasia II' after a summer tour, with 'Business and Pleasure' coming out the following winter.

Earlier this month, Banks wrote an open letter to Sarah Palin, after the former Alaska governor threatened to sue her for a series of offensive comments made on Twitter. 

The rapper initially apologised for the remarks, which were prompted by a satirical news story that Banks believed to be real, before backtracking and criticising Palin again.

Nicki Minaj’s entry was introduced by her former mentor Lil Wayne, who first signed the rapper to his Young Money imprint.

“She’s reached far beyond everything I would have imagined. Man, she’s so influential and doing all the right things,” he wrote. She’s an icon, a boss and a role model to all these young girls out here on how to do it the right way.”

He added: “Nicki Minaj will go down as one of the best to do it in the history of music.”

Adele, who appears in the “Icons” category of the list, was praised by Jennifer Lawrence, who wrote: “Adele is a gift, an international treasure, but she’s also sweet, funny, intelligent and beautiful. Bitch.”

Viet Cong change name to Preoccupations,"Viet Cong have announced that they are changing their name.

From now on the Canadian post-punk group will be known as Preoccupations. 

The group have faced criticised in the past for their former name, which led to some promoters cancelling their gigs. Viet Cong was the political organization and army in South Vietnam and Cambodia that fought the United States and South Vietnamese governments during the Vietnam War. 

Last September, the four-piece said they would change their name before the release of their next record.

In a statement announcing the change earlier today, they apologised for causing offence.

It reads: “We apologize to those who were adversely affected by our former band name. This was never anticipated nor our intent. We are artists and not politicians, we understand that the name reflected pain to some individuals and we are happy to change it and move on and focus on our music.”

Frontman Matt Flegel admitted that the band were not fully aware of the context of their former name.

""We were pretty naive, and pretty ignorant on the subject. We know a lot more now. If we knew what we know now then we would definitely not call the band that,” he told Pitchfork.

Flegel said that conversations with fans of Vietnamese heritage led to the decision.

Press

“I don't really keep track of what people are saying online or social media. Anything I learned was face to face from people at shows, and directly from protesters, and hearing stories about Vietnamese refugees,” he said.

“We've never really read about that side of things; we didn't know anything about that side of the war. But it was an eye-opener, and it was great talking to people about it, hearing things directly from people who have had the experience of the terrible things coming out of the war.

“It was always civil, and we met some great people because of it. We talked to fans of our band who are of a Vietnamese background. It's really helpful to have a face-to-face conversation with another human being that has family, or has been directly affected by something, rather than just hearsay on the internet.”

Preoccupations have finished recording their second album and are scheduled to play two gigs in London in June.

And although she played the iconic part of CJ Parker for five seasons of the series, as well as in Baywatch the Movie: Forbidden Paradise, and Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding, Anderson won't be returning to the role she made so famous this time around.

Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, who is replacing David Hasselhoff in the new film as Mitch Buchanan, announced the news to the world via his Instagram account yesterday - and has already racked up nearly half a million likes for his trouble.

Action Bronson cut from a second US college spring concert ,"Action Bronson has been stripped from the bill of a second American university's spring concert as a result of controversial lyrics that have recently come to light. 

Already banned from headlining George Washington University’s Spring Fling in Washington DC, the New York rapper will also now no longer appear at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, following a successful petition organised by the student body.   

In a post on Facebook, the students responsible for booking entertainments at the college said that they ""took the petition ... and the views expressed in the comment section very seriously"" after being made aware of the content of ""Consensual Rape"", an unreleased song the New Yorker recorded in 2011. 

Jenn Five

“In the beginning of March we were made aware of the severity and depth of some of Action Bronson’s lyrics,"" a representative wrote on the Trinity College Barnyard Entertainment Facebook page. 

""We began to create a strategy to keep members of our community safe and began drafting our response to the backlash that we anticipated. Following news that Action Bronson was being removed as the headlining artist for Spring Weekend at The George Washington University, our executive-board committee voted on March 31st to remove Action Bronson from our Spring Weekend concert because of his lyrics, music, videos, and the misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia that they promote.”

Bronson has yet to respond to this latest development, but in a statement relating to his removal from GWU's Spring Fling, he said: “I understand that when it comes to musicians, and more specifically rappers, the lyrics I say are taken to heart many times as a representation of my beliefs or true feelings. SO please let me make this very clear: I think rape and acts of violence toward woman are DISGUSTING. I would never condone anything remotely close to that type of behavior, and it’s certainly not what I’m about at all. But, the song in question has caused people discomfort and pain and I’m sincerely sorry about it.”",http://www.nme.com/news/action-bronson/93166,http://nme.assets.ipccdn.co.uk/images/ActionBronson01Getty491862367_170514.jpg
"Rare version of David Bowie's 'Hunky Dory' expected to fetch £36,000 at auction","A rare pre-release copy of David Bowie’s 'Hunky Dory' album is expected to sell for tens of thousands of pounds after it goes up for auction today. 

The record in question is an acetate disc created after the album was mastered but before it was released to the public as a finished vinyl. It was used as the precursor for a limited run of 500 promotional copies of Bowie's popular fourth album, released in 1971, which were given to music industry executives. Versions of this white label record, which is known amongst collectors as the 'BOWPROMO' are themselves tremendously valuable, with one selling for around $10,000 on ebay in 2012.

The acetate is believed to be particularly valuable for a number of reasons, not least because it is accompanied by a tracklisting believed by handwriting experts to have been written by Bowie himself. It also features a song called 'Bombers', which did not appear on subsequent versions of the album, having been replaced 'Fill Your Heart'; the track wouldn't be heard for another 19 years, when it was eventually released as a single.

Catawiki

Acetate is generally considered much more fragile than vinyl, but this copy is said still to spin. It was owned by Mick Ronson, who played lead guitar in Bowie’s backing band at the time, and was passed through family and friends until it arriving in the hands of its current owner, Dennis Graham, in 1973.

He said: “It’s quite a funny story on how I came to own it. The record had been given to my neighbour as a gift from Mick Ronson’s mum and he ended up giving it to me in exchange for a bottle of beer! I kept it for all these years and it’s unbelievable to see how much it’s now worth.”

The acetate is being auctioned by the online rarities site Catawiki, which hopes to fetch at least £36,000.

Prince's first manager: 'he was beyond anybody that I had ever met',"Even as a precocious teenager barely able to vote, Prince, who died tragically yesterday at the age of 57, was obviously on another plane compared with other artists, according to his first manager.

Owen Husney was one of the first people to work with Prince, who at the time still went by his given name - Prince Rogers Nelson. He recalls a young man who was ""beyond anybody that I had ever met"".

He told NPR: ""You know, he had just turned 18, and it was very much a co-working atmosphere between he and I at that point. Once he went on to his second album and all the subsequent albums, obviously, he became Prince, and he was very much in charge. But he was very willing to listen to me and to take my direction, which I think is probably the only time that ever happened, to be honest with you.""

Getty

He recalls the single-mindedness his protégé displayed from the start - especially when he had to try and arrange a record deal putting unprecedented creative control in the hands of an unknown teenager.

""When we signed the deal with Warner Bros,"" said Husney, ""I had the great job of going to the chairman of Warner Bros and saying that an 18-year-old artist, who has never made an album before, is going to be producing his own album and having complete creative control. I didn't relish that meeting!""

He added: ""Prince is, to me, one of the greatest artists of our time. And I think he's one of those legacy artists of which there's maybe 10 or 11. I put him up there with Miles Davis, with Hendrix and Dylan. I put him up there in that stratosphere.""",http://www.nme.com/news/prince/93168,http://nme.assets.ipccdn.co.uk/images/2016_PrincePurpleRain_GettyImages86103158_220416.jpg
Mumford and Sons announce 'Johannesburg' mini album,"Mumford and Sons have announced a new mini-album entitled 'Johannesburg', a product of their South African tour recording in the title city. The release features their touring partners Baaba Maal (a Senegalese music legend), Beatenberg (a South African pop group) and The Very Best (a London-based, Malawi-inspired jazz/ hip-hop act).

The mini-album was recorded over the course of two sessions in Johannesburg that the band have described as ""all day and all night,"" as part of a sizeable South African tour undertaken in January and February this year. 

The blurb for the five-track release (track listing below) describes the album as follows:

""The South African Broadcasting Corporation had a room. It had two. Literally, two rooms. A few corridors away, and around the corner. It was a magnificent building though, all imposing wood panelling and endless corridors leading to more corridors. It had something a bit brutalist about it. It had a vibe.""
 
""The song which opens Johannesburg, 'There Will Be Time', is a belter. Tender but not shackled by any sense of restraint. It has that special inference of yearning that Mumford & Sons do so incredibly well, and when combining that with the musicianship of Baaba Maal’s glorious crew and his vocals which interweave mesmerisingly with that yearning thing, you’ve got something really quite otherworldly."" 

""Otherworldly indeed. When the musicians amassed on stage in Pretoria to perform it together, a terrific storm raged overhead and the thunder seemed to crack with percussionist Mamadou Saar's every other beat. It was quite something to behold. Pathetic fallacy, of sorts. In the rain the good people of Pretoria and its surrounding villages danced and embraced the moment. This one was theirs to embrace.""

View the trailer for the new release, due on June 17, via YouTube, below:



The band have described 'The Very Best' as the 'glue' of the new project, with Marcus Mumford saying: ""The whole thing came together because of Johan [Hugo, The Very Best] really - and actually they had acted like sonic trailblazers in a lot of ways - marrying afrobeat rhythms, Esau and Baaba's voices and languages, over Western songwriting.""

Winston Marshall continues ""Through Johan we met the legend that is Baaba Maal, which has been one of the highlights of our career."" 

""I had the good fortune of taking Baaba up on an invitation to his home town of Podor in Senegal for the Blues de Fleuve festival in 2013, and I also got to hear and play with Baaba and his musicians (with Johan at the helm) as they made Baaba's very beautiful 'The Traveller' album which has recently been released.”

The first track from the album, 'There Will Be Time', featuring Baaba Maal, has been released on Spotify, listen below:



Mumford and Sons will headline British Summer Time Hyde Park this July, and recently soundtracked a film on homelessness. They have pledged to donate profits from their show in North Carolina to LGBT charities in protest at the state's new 'bathroom' laws.

Eamonn Holmes criticised for saying Prince was a 'girls' artist' on 'This Morning',"TV presenter Eamonn Holmes has been criticised following comments he made earlier today about Prince after the music icon's death.

Prince was found dead at his Paisley Park home yesterday afternoon (April 21). He was 57.

Discussing the news on ITV's This Morning on Friday (April 22), Holmes told wife and co-host Ruth Langsford: ""I think there was a bit of a problem with Prince. He was more of a girls' artist than a boys' artist.""

He added: ""It's the flamboyancy... We find it hard to relate to him because there’s that flamboyancy that you had with David Bowie as well.""

Holmes went on to agree that Prince was a ""incredible"" musician.



Following the comments, Holmes has been criticised online by Twitter users. One fan wrote: ""Prince and Bowie did not appeal to women more than men. They were idolised by both for their brilliance and innovation"".

Holmes has not yet responded to the criticism.

Roger Daltrey on Axl Rose joining AC/DC: 'Give me a break',"Roger Daltrey has scoffed at the news that Axl Rose will be replacing Brian Johnson as the lead singer for AC/DC after more than 40 years.

Rose is taking a break from his own band, Gun'n'Roses, in order to stand in for Johnson on the remainder of AC/DC's Rock or Bust World Tour, after the Australian legend was forced to retire from performing music for good or face permanent hearing loss. 

""I mean, go and see karaoke with Axl Rose? Give me a break,"" said Daltrey, the 72-year-old lead singer of The Who, to Canadian media. 

Pooneh Ghana/NME

Paying tribute to his friend, Daltrey told the London Free Press that ""I really feel badly for Brian"". 

He said: ""It must be heartbreaking for him after all the service he’s given that band over the years. I thought their farewell statement to the press and to Brian was fairly curt to say the least. I felt for him. That must have hurt.

""I’ve spoken to Brian. He’s got loads of other things he wants to do in his life. I think AC/DC will miss Brian much more than Brian will miss AC/DC. There you go. What do you expect from Australians?"" 

AC/DC confirmed last week that Rose would join the band for remainder of their world tour. He is due to play 12 European dates, including two UK shows, at London's Olympic Stadium on 4 June and Manchester's Etihad Stadium on 9 June. After that, he will rejoin his own band for their North American tour, before returning to AC/DC and completing 10 shows which were postponed after Johnson announced his retirement.

""It’s interesting that in America the problem you’re allowed to talk about is Black Lives Matter,"" she said. ""It’s not a new thing to me — it’s what Lauryn Hill was saying in the 1990s, or Public Enemy in the 1980s.""

MIA went on to add: ""Is Beyoncé or Kendrick Lamar going to say Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter? Or this kid in Pakistan matters? That’s a more interesting question. And you cannot ask it on a song that’s on Apple, you cannot ask it on an American TV programme, you cannot create that tag on Twitter, Michelle Obama is not going to hump you back.""

Elsewhere in the interview, MIA discussed growing up in Sri Lanka and living through a civil war. The singer said she never thought she would escape Sri Lanka with her life.

“I feel like I should have died a long time ago,” she said. “I’m surprised I’m still alive, to be honest. I came from war. When I was growing up I didn’t really think I’d live beyond about 25... I never thought I would be old enough to drive or have a house or raise a child. Having to do it is really difficult.”

Emilia Clarke rules herself out of any future involvement in 'Terminator' franchise,"Emilia Clarke has ruled herself out of appearing as Sarah Connor in any future Terminator sequels. 

Clarke, best known for her role as Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, played Connor in last year's Terminator Genisys. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently hinted at there being a long term future for the franchise, although a sixth film in the sci-fi series recently disappeared from Paramount's release schedule. 

During an interview she gave this week, Clarke distanced herself from the franchise. ""No,"" Clarke said when Coming Soon asked if she might again play Sarah Connor in future Terminator sequels. ""Can I say that? It’s okay. No. Uh-uh. But I have some very different roles coming up.""

One of those roles is Me Before You, which opens this summer and sees Clarke star opposite fellow Brit Sam Claflin. 

“I read the book and it was just the most beautiful thing I had ever read,” she said. “I was shooting ‘Terminator’ at the time and had a rocket launcher in my hand while crying like a little girl. I felt like the author, Jojo Moyes, had found a part of me and just wrote it down. I knew that I just had to play the role.”

Me Before You stars Clarke as a woman who begins caring for a wealthy young man (Claflin) after he is paralysed.

One hundred Limp Bizkit fans show up for fake 4/20 gig at Ohio petrol station,"Limp Bizkit fans were left disappointed on Wednesday (April 20) after being duped into believing that the nu-metal band were playing a special 4/20 show at a petrol station in Ohio.

Speculation began when a local resident named Brian Baker created a Facebook event called 'Limp Bizkit to play 4/20 Secret Show', which listed the US group as playing a show at the Sunoco petrol station in Dayton, Ohio on April 20, 2017.

Despite warnings from local police, the petrol station staff and the band themselves that the rumoured gig was a hoax, and the fact that the advertised date was supposed to be a year later, local news site Whio.com reports that over 100 people still arrived at the petrol station expecting Limp Bizkit to perform. Some had even made their own t-shirts for the occasion. Five police cars were also called to the scene.

Baker refused to take blame for duping fans, telling The Daily Beast : ""I made the event for 2017—and then the people decided that they want it now"".

Father John Misty slams 'bullshit' US anti-LGBT state law,"Father John Misty will donate profits from his upcoming gig in North Carolina to an LGBT support centre. 

Earlier this month North Carolina passed a state law which means individuals must use bathrooms corresponding to their biological sex, a move which negatively impacts on trans people. 

Pearl Jam, Bruce Springsteen and Ringo Starr have already pulled gigs in protest at the ruling. However, other artists (including Against Me! and Cyndi Lauper) have vowed to play anyway as an act of protest. 

Currently on a US tour, Father John Misty will play at the Filmore in Charlotte on April 27. He has issued a statement about the gig and confirmed that proceeds from the night will go to local charity Time Out Youth.

In a statement to Rolling Stone, he labelled the bill “bullshit,” but clarified why he has decided to go ahead with his gig. 

""The bill is obviously bullshit. [If] I thought playing a show for my fans in North Carolina was in any way some tacit endorsement of this fearful, petty, ignorant nonsense, I wouldn’t. I also play states that have oppressive drug laws designed to imprison the disenfranchised, rig elections, deny women their dignity, defend the reckless and insane practice of selling guns and sustain a permanent underclass with hypocritical, opportunist readings of archaic documents written by land-stealers who never intended political privilege to extend past their buddies. These are obviously all huge systemic problems. But for me, this show represents a start in investing in the plight of other Americans.""

Similarly, Mumford and Sons made a donation from their recent gig in the state to a local LGBT charity.

Father John Misty released latest album 'I Love You, Honeybear' in 2015. He tours the UK in May with the headline shows starting at Leeds O2 Academy on May 11.

Biffy Clyro's Simon Neil says issues with mental health led him to doubt songwriting ability,"Biffy Clyro's Simon Neil has admitted that he was in a ""terrible headspace"" during the early process of making the band's new album, 'Ellipsis'. 

Speaking to NME as part of this week's cover feature, Neil discusses his mental health and reveals that touring around the band's last album 'Opposites' saw him struggling. 

Following a UK headline tour in April 2013, the band called off a series of shows, citing the frontman’s “serious respiratory problem”. 

""I had a bit of a ‘do’,"" Neil says now. “This is going to turn into a right downer interview, but before that our very first tour manager died of leukaemia; Storm [Thorgerson, designer of their artwork] died; my gran died; my best friend’s brother died on Christmas Day… It felt like when things couldn’t get any worse, they just kept getting worse.”



Neil then fell into a five-week period that he describes as a “funk”, during which his confidence in his own songwriting deserted him: ""I was just in a terrible headspace,"" he explains. ""It’s just the way I am. I’m always going have a bit of trouble convincing in here [taps his head] that everything’s going alright, when it is going alright. I needed to shed a skin in a serious way last year. We’d done more things than I could ever have dreamed of and I still felt slightly unfulfilled and unhappy.""

After deciding that he ""needed to sort my fucking shit out"", Neil and his wife left Scotland and went to LA for two months. This was where his mood changed and 'Ellipsis' began to take shape. 

""It happened when I least expected it,"" says the singer. ""I was sat at the piano and wrote three songs, sending them to the boys, going, ‘I’m really excited by these,’ and they got back, saying, ‘They’re fucking unbelievable’. I’ll always remember that, because that day was the turning point in getting my confidence back.""

'Ellipsis' will be released on July 8 via Warner Bros Records and 14th Floor Recordings.

Biffy Clyro recently announced that they’ll headline this summer’s Reading (August 28) and Leeds Festivals (August 26).
 
They will also play their biggest Scottish show at Glasgow’s Bellahouston Park on August 27. Part of this year’s Glasgow Summer Sessions, the 35,000 capacity show features special guests Fall Out Boy, Wolf Alice and Cage The Elephant.

Frank Ocean shares poignant tribute to Prince,"Frank Ocean has shared a moving personal tribute to Prince in which he credits the late musician for inspiring him to be “to be more daring and intuitive”.

The R&B singer-songwriter posted a rare message on his Tumblr following the news of the icon’s death.

Ocean said that his favourite song of all time is ‘When You’re Were Mine’, “a simple song with a simple melody that makes you wish you thought of it first, even though you never would have”.

The ‘Channel Orange’ artist also said that Prince’s flamboyant style encouraged him to “feel more comfortable with how I identify sexually simply by his display of freedom from and irreverence for obviously archaic ideas like gender conformity”.

Read the tribute in full on Ocean’s Tumblr, or below:

“i'm not even gonna say rest in peace because it’s bigger than death. i never met the man (i was too nervous the one time i saw him) and i never saw him play live, regrettably. i only know the legends I’ve heard from folks and what i’ve heard and seen from his deep catalog of propellant, fearless, virtuosic work. my assessment is that he learned early on how little value to assign to someone else’s opinion of you.. an infectious sentiment that seemed soaked into his clothes, his hair, his walk, his guitar and his primal scream. he wrote my favorite song of all time, ‘when you were mine’. it’s a simple song with a simple melody that makes you wish you thought of it first, even though you never would have - a flirtatious brand of genius that feels approachable. he was a straight black man who played his first televised set in bikini bottoms and knee high heeled boots, epic. he made me feel more comfortable with how i identify sexually simply by his display of freedom from and irreverence for obviously archaic ideas like gender conformity etc. he moved me to be more daring and intuitive with my own work by his demonstration - his denial of the prevailing model...his fight for his intellectual property - ‘slave’ written across the forehead, name changed to a symbol... an all out rebellion against exploitation. A vanguard and genius by every metric I know of who affected many in a way that will outrun oblivion for a long while. I’m proud to be a Prince fan(stan) for life.“

He continued: “Michelle and I join millions of fans from around the world in mourning the sudden death of Prince. Few artists have influenced the sound and trajectory of popular music more distinctly, or touched quite so many people with their talent. As one of the most gifted and prolific musicians of our time, Prince did it all. Funk. R&B. Rock and roll. He was a virtuoso instrumentalist, a brilliant bandleader, and an electrifying performer.

“A strong spirit transcends rules,” Prince once said -- and nobody's spirit was stronger, bolder, or more creative. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, his band, and all who loved him.

Grimes talks heavier leanings and artistic angles in Zane Lowe interview,"Grimes has spoken about her rockier leanings and how 'Art Angels' was nearly a rock record in a new interview, as well as touching on the art behind her music.

Talking to Zane Lowe on his Beats1 radio show last night (April 20), the Canadian also presented a forty minute remix, including a new track by her former collaborator Aristophanes. 'Untitled' was produced by Will Butler of Arcade Fire.

Grimes - a.k.a Claire Boucher - went into particular detail about her Art Angels track 'California', saying “I wanted it to be a country song but like a dancehall country song,” before adding “I mean for this record I actually thought I was making a rock record. I thought it was my big rock statement."" 

""Nobody else thought that besides me. I was trying to do a Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness kind of thing. The Pumpkins kinda bridge the gap between rock and emo. They’re kind of in-between My Chem and Nine Inch Nails.”

Boucher also confirmed that 'Art Angels' came out as a surprise release due to ""not finishing it until the last minute,"" before adding “I was at a point where I was going to go either a heavier direction or a more ‘Pin’ and ‘Easily’ and some of those sort of songs. Everyone said you should do these songs to establish that you can actually write songs before you do more crazy experimental shit.”

Listen to the interview via iTunes, below:



And to the new track by Aristophanes, 'Untitled', below:



On the artistic side of her work, Grimes added “All my music videos are fake trailers for fake movies. That’s how I think about it I just love trailers,"" explaining the visual side is “always kinda in the back of your head. You don't want to be too intentional.”

The Canadian also spoke about performing with Janelle Monae at Coachella, saying:

“She’s been one of my favorite artists for a long time and even the community she comes out of OutKast and all the Atlanta acts I feel like they’re so post genre. All the musicians from that community seem to have such a diverse array of influences.”

Grimes' full remix playlist was as follows:

Dawn Richard x TITANS - James Dean
Kali Uchis - Ridin Round

AC/DC auditioned tribute band singer to replace frontman Brian Johnson,"The singer in an AC/DC tribute band has claimed that he was auditioned by the classic rock band to be their new frontman.

The Australian hard rock group were recently looking for a new vocalist after long-time frontman Brian Johnson was advised by doctors to quit touring with the outfit amid fears of complete hearing loss. AC/DC eventually opted for Axl Rose as Johnson's replacement.

Prior to recruiting the Guns N' Roses star however, the band also auditioned Lee Robinson, the singer in AC/DC covers band Thunderstruck, according to Robinson himself. On their website, the group claim to ""offer the most complete and authentic reproduction of AC/DC’s sound and stage performance in North Carolina and beyond"".

Robinson recently told Blabbermouth that the band flew him into Atlanta during March to audition for them. He says AC/DC bassist Cliff Williams had found out about the tribute act after stumbling upon Youtube clips of their performances.

Although Robinson had initial nerves, he says these subsided when he found out that he could use a teleprompter that Johnson had to remember lyrics. ""When I heard that, I pretty much passed out. I didn’t have to worry about forgetting the lyrics anymore,"" he said.

Of singing with AC/DC themselves, Robinson added: ""Once they started playing I was just excited and was just standing there like what the hell. I'm playing with AC/DC!"".

""Stevie [Young, guitarist] said, ‘Hell yeah, that’s the right way to do it,’ when I asked if we could do the audition in standard. But that’s the only way I know how to sing it"". Guitarist Angus Young was apparently also impressed, telling Robinson: ""Whatever happens, you’ve got a helluva voice.""



Brian Johnson had been AC/DC’s frontman since 1980, joining the group following the death of previous singer Bon Scott. He recently released a statement speaking of his sadness at having to stop performing with the band.

AC/DC currently have 12 European live dates booked in for May and June, including two UK shows: London's Olympic Stadium on June 4 and Manchester's Etihad Stadium on June 9. 

Rumours linking Axl Rose to the band had been circulating for several weeks. Meanwhile, Angus Young joined Axl Rose onstage at Coachella last weekend for Guns N' Roses' headline set.",http://www.nme.com/news/acdc/93161,http://nme.assets.ipccdn.co.uk/images/2016ACDCtributebandThunderstruck.png
Lily Allen in Twitter row over Rita Ora's Prince tribute,"Lily Allen was engaged in a Twitter row last night (April 21) following her response to fellow pop star Rita Ora's tribute to Prince.

As reported, Prince was found dead by police at his Paisley Park home yesterday afternoon. He was 57.

Following the news, Ora posted a message on Twitter and Instagram, calling Prince her ""dear kind friend"" while remembering their ""dance-offs"" and the ""laughter we shared"".

Allen then responded to Ora's tweet, since deleted, saying: ""pics or it never happened"". After Ora's fans reacted negatively to her comments, perceiving them to have been a slight to the star, Allen later clarified: ""I didn't mean that in a mean way, I'm just jealous [Ora was] so close to my idol.""

However, Allen's apology did not deter her from criticism from Twitter users, among them The Only Way Is Essex cast member Vas J Morgan, who reacted angrily to the comments and accused the singer of ""constantly attack[ing] women"". ""Stop taking your insecurities out on others. It's a horrible quality,"" he tweeted.

Other Twitter users echoed his sentiments and Allen has subsequently deleted her tweet. 

Tributes to Prince have ranged far and wide with President Barack Obama stating ""Today, the world lost a creative icon"" and musicians including Madonna, Frank Ocean, The Weeknd and Katy Perry leading the tributes. 

Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger also paid tribute to Prince following the star's death.

Justin Bieber offends Prince fans with misguided Instagram comment,"Justin Bieber has offended Prince fans with an ill-advised Instagram comment. 

The pop star joined in the conversation around Prince's death yesterday and commented on fellow musician Andrew Watt's Instagram post paying tribute to the late star.

Watt posted an image of himself wearing a Prince T-Shirt and wrote a lengthy caption in which he stated that his hero was ""the last of the greatest living performers"". The line was in keeping with Watt's passionate comments, in which he described himself as ""truly beside myself"" and ""devastated"" about the news. 

    This past Tuesday night before my show I was picking out an outfit...I was so tired from the past week of endless traveling and gigging that I grabbed my Prince shirt and said fuck it I&#39;m gonna channel the purple one tonight...I didn&#39;t shower after the gig out of pure exhaustion...I went to sleep in that shirt and then I wore it again all day yesterday...today waking up to this news I am truly beside myself...devastated...the last of the greatest living performers...my guitar idol...his connection to ALL his instruments yielded a sexual transcending aura and the world is just less fucking cool without him walking on it... &#34;Electric word life It means forever and that&#39;s a mighty long time But I&#39;m here to tell you There&#39;s something else... The after world&#34; #RIPPRINCE A photo posted by Andrew Watt (@andrew50watt) on Apr 21, 2016 at 11:06am PDT


However, it appears that the claim about Prince being the last of the great live acts upset Bieber somewhat. As screenshots show, he replied to Watt and disputed the idea; seemingly suggesting someone still living holds the title or possibly that he is that artist.
